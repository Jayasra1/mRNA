# mRNA: Efficienct mapping space exploration for Reconfigurable Neural Accelerator
## Introduction
**mRNA** is a mapping space exploration tool for **MAERI**. 
MAERI is a DNN Spatial Accelerator which is able to support flexible Dataflows. It aims at efficient mapping datalfows due to the diverse deep learning landscape. Detail of **MAERI** can refer to ASPLOS 2018 paper below:

>Hyoukjun Kwon, Ananda Samajdar, and Tushar Krishna, MAERI: Enabling Flexible Dataflow Mapping over DNN Accelerators via Reconfigurable Interconnects, ASPLOS 2018

**mRNA** generates the DNN Model which is implemented by Tensorflow, extract the necessary information from each layer and generate the optimal mapping strategy which map a layer onto MAERI. It has three basically functionalities:

1. Efficienctly search the optimal DNN mapping for MAERI
2. Mapping space exploration tool for developers to understand the impact of mapping over MAERI
3. Generate the Network configuration for MERI.

Detail implementation of mRNA can refer to ISPASS 2019 paper below.

## Tool Setup
1. If you want to use Front-end Paser, you should have **python3**, **Tensorflow** environment and **lark-parser** package. The install information of **Tensorflow** goes to 
[here](https://tensorflow.google.cn/install). The install information of **lark-parser** package goes to 
[here](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark). And the for information of installing **python3** please go to [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. For using **mRNA**, you should install **Gglags**, the download and install information of **Gflags** please go to [here](https://github.com/gflags/gflags).
3. Install instruction:

```
	Enter into mRNA folder
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ../
	make
```

## Command Guide

### Front-end Parser
The Front-end Parser get the DNN Model as input and output the information of each layer include DNN Model name, layer type and name. And four dimensional representation of input, weight, output and hidden unit (for LSTM). The command example is:

```
python3 network_parser.py #dnn_model#.py
```
And all the output parameters of each layer for a DNN mdoel are located inside param folder. 
The **input** folder contains all the layer representations for four DNN Model (alexnet, resnet, vggnet and rnn). We also provide the Tensorflow implementation so that you can try to generate the parameters of each layer for a specific model.  

###Analyzer

You can use **--help** command to check all the descriptions of each command

```
	build/MAERI_Mapper --help
```
If you want to understand the impact of mapping over MAERI, example below is the command of mapping a convolutional layer of alexnet, and generating the profile result for this layer

```
	cd mNRA/input/alexnet
	../../build/MAERI_Mapper -model_para="Model_parameter_4.txt" -show_energy 
	-config_file="Config_file.txt" -num_ms=256 -dn_bw=128 -rn_bw=256 -performance
```
If you want to generate the configuration, you should add **-genconfig** option in the commmand.

```
	../../build/MAERI_Mapper -model_para="Model_parameter_2.txt" -show_energy 
	-config_file="Config_file.txt" -dn_bw=128 -rn_bw=256 â€“performance -genconfig
```
